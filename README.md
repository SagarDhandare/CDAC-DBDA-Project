## Project Name: Automatic Optimal N-Shot learning for Brain Tumor Detection
This repository consists of all the files that are required for our project (Automatic Optimal N-Shot learning for Brain Tumor Detection)

A Brain tumor is considered as one of the aggressive diseases, among children and adults. Proper treatment, planning, and accurate diagnostics needs to be implemented to improve the life expectancy of the patients. The best technique to detect brain tumors is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A huge amount of image data is generated through the scans. These images are examined by the radiologist. A manual examination can be error-prone due to the level of complexities involved in brain tumors and their properties. Despite deep convolutional neural networks achieved impressive progress in medical image computing and analysis, its paradigm of supervised learning demands a large number of training images and complex hyperparameter optimization processes. In clinical practices, collection of huge number of MRIs is difficult to acquire. We have developed a deep learning model with few-shot learning and Automatic Hyperparameter Optimization for brain tumor detection.
